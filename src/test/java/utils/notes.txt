1)constats class - very basic class- just defining the final constant path -- System.getProperty("user.dir")
---> every user will get their unique path, this path we will not change, its the standard organized framework
2) configReader class
3) CommonMethods class- storing common functionalities -- storing the operations
that we will perform regularly we keep in here
---> example Open browser, navigating url, with chrome or with firefox,
 the commonMethods class allows me to override the path,
and reuse the methods
--> other examples -- click operations (with parameters as web elements-
it will override the method each time we use it)
---> same we can do for sendText, JS click, screenshots
all the methods above we can add in our common methods
